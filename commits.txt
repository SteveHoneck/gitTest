    Create repository via GitHub website
    Create local folder and file, initiate local repository
        Command: git init
    Initial commit
        Command: git add .
        Command: git commit -m "Initial commit."
    Link to remote repository
        Command: git remote add origin https://github.com/SteveHoneck/gitTest.git
                git branch -M main
                git push -u origin main

    2nd commit
        Command: git add .
        Command: git commit -m "2nd commit."
        Command: git push

    Create new branch, check it out
        Command: git checkout -b branch-1
    
    1st commit to branch-1 and push to remote repository
        Command: git add .
        Command: git commit -m "1st commit, branch 1."    
        Command: git push -u origin branch-1

    2nd commit to branch-1 and push to remote repository
        Command: git add .
        Command: git commit -m "2nd commit, branch 1."    
        Command: git push -u origin branch-1 <!--Did not need the '-u origin branch-1', that is only needed for the first push of a branch to a remote repository.-->

    3rd commit to branch-1 and push to remote repository
        Command: git add .
        Command: git commit -m "3rd commit, branch 1."    
        Command: git push 

At this point, there are 2 branches on GitHub. Main branch is at "2nd commit." and branch-1 is at "3rd commit, branch 1." 
Went to '<> Code' tab on GitHub, clicked the '[branchSymbol] 2 branches' link and clicked '[symbol] New pull request' on 'branch-1'. 
Put info in the pull request title and 'Write' tab, clicked 'Create pull request'. 
Clicked 'Close pull request' (to see how it worked) and pull request was closed. 
Clicked re-open pull request, then clicked the "Merge pull request, Create a merge commit" and "Confirm merge". 
Then clicked "Delete branch" after merge was complete.

At this point, 'branch-1' is deleted, and main branch has all the changes from branch-1, and main branch is the only branch.

    Switch back to editing on main branch.
        Command: git checkout main
        Command: git branch
            branch-1
            * main

The local repository is still showing both branch-1 and main. branch-1 has been deleted on the remote repository, but should also be deleted on the local repository.

    Delete branch-1 from local repository
        Command: git branch -d branch-1
            warning: deleting branch 'branch-1' that has been merged to
            'refs/remotes/origin/branch-1', but not yet merged to HEAD.
            Deleted branch branch-1 (was ba6fa10).

Not sure what the warning is about, branch-1 had a pull request and was merged into main branch.

The local repository now only shows main branch.

Tried to save all the above typed in but could not, VSCode threw a save error for everything that was after line 17. When I switched to main branch, the file I had open in VSCode did not reflect the main branch with the pull/merge of branch-1 but I continued to type notes in the file, so that must have caused the conflict.

    Pull what is on the remote main branch into the file I had open in VSCode
	    Command: git pull

File open in VSCode now reflects remote main branch (lines 18-35 show up) and everything after (36-78) show up as new additions.


Saved all the above edits (lines 36-78), commit to main branch, and push to remote repository via commands below.

    3nd commit (main branch)
        Command: git add .
        Command: git commit -m "3rd commit."
        Command: git push

-------------------------------------------------

Checking how branches work when main is updated

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Updates to main will go here
Clicked 'branch' button in bottom left corner of VS code, selected main.
Now on main branch, lines 79 through 96 are not there (branch-2 updates from first commit), add these updates to main branch in what is marked 'update area' in branch-2(under line 84).
     
	4th commit (main branch)
        VSCode: save        
        Command: git add .
        Command: git commit -m "4th commit."
        Command: git push
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Create new branch, check it out
        Command: git checkout -b branch-2
        VSCode: save

    1st commit to branch-2 and push to remote repository
        Command: git add .
        Command: git commit -m "1st commit, branch 2."    
        Command: git push -u origin branch-2

branch-2 should contain line 79 through 95, main should not


Clicked 'branch' button in bottom left corner of VS code, selected branch-2.

Now on branch-2, updates from main "4th commit." are not there.

Process to update a branch based on changes in master (https://gist.github.com/whoisryosuke/36b3b41e738394170b9a7c230665e6b9)

	Add changes from main to branch-2
		Command: git merge main
			CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in commits.txt
			Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

Showed screen with Current Change and Incoming Change, things did not line up, so cut and past Incoming Change text into Current Change section where it was meant to go
		VSCode: clicked "Accept Current Change"
		VSCode: save
		Command: git add .
		Command: git commit -m "Update branch-2 from changes to main."
		Command: git push

Now, branch-2 contains the added text from main, but in a different spot than main.

Created pull request from branch-2 page, branches were able to be automatically merged.

Confirmed merge and deleted branch-2.

Everything is in expected spot on github.

Switch to main branch.

Clicked 'branch' button in bottom left corner of VS code, selected main.

Update local main with remote main that has the pull request completed.
	Command: git pull

Add all above notes (106 - 144) and commit to main
		VSCode: save
		Command: git add .
		Command: git commit -m "Add notes for updating branch with changes to main."
		Command: git push
